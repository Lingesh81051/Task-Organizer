A Task Organizer is a list of tasks that need to be completed, typically organized in order of priority. 
It is one of the simplest solutions for task management and provides a minimal and elegant way for 
managing tasks a person wishes to accomplish. aim is to design a simple and elegant website for people to keep a track of the status of their tasks. Making a Task Organizer list is an easy and important task that everyone should do. The 
immense satisfaction that one gets when completing the task and marking it on the list are 
incomparable. Moreover, creating a list of tasks ensure you don’t miss out on anything. It’s a 
scientific fact that when you write the tasks that you need to complete, you are even more motivated 
to complete it. With this in mind, we come to build a platform which will help people create their 
own task list.



***Steps to run the Project***

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a>.Installing Python's Tkinter library is usually straightforward, as it comes bundled with Python itself. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


However, the exact steps might vary depending on your operating system. Here are the general steps for installing and verifying Tkinter on different platforms:


**Windows:**

1. **Check Python Installation:** First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Verify Tkinter Installation:** Tkinter is included by default with Python on Windows, so you don't need to install it separately. To verify its installation, open the command prompt and run the following command:
   
   ```
   python -m tkinter
   ```

   This should open a simple Tkinter window, confirming that Tkinter is installed.




**macOS:**

1. **Check Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed. macOS usually comes with a pre-installed version of Python, but you might consider installing the latest version from the official Python website.

2. **Verify Tkinter Installation:** Tkinter is included by default with Python on macOS. To check if it's installed, open the Terminal and run:
   
   ```
   python3 -m tkinter
   ```

   This should open a basic Tkinter window.





**Linux:**

1. **Check Python Installation:** Check if Python is installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not, you can use your package manager to install it.

2. **Install Tkinter:** On some Linux distributions, Tkinter might not be included with the default Python installation. You can install it using the package manager that corresponds to your distribution:

   - **Debian/Ubuntu:** Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

   - **Fedora:** Run the following command:
     ```
     sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
     ```

   - **Arch Linux:** Run:
     ```
     sudo pacman -S tk
     ```

3. **Verify Tkinter Installation:** After installing, you can verify the installation using the same command as for macOS and Windows:
   
   ```
   python3 -m tkinter
   ```

Remember that the commands to open a Tkinter window might differ slightly based on the version of Python you're using. Use `python -m tkinter` for Python 2 and `python3 -m tkinter` for Python 3.

Once you've completed these steps, you should have Tkinter installed and ready to use for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.

b>.open the "Task.py" from the "Task List" folder using any Python editor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Installing Visual Studio Code:**

1. **Download:** Go to the official Visual Studio Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   
2. **Choose Your OS:** Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. **Install:**
   - **Windows:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install.
   - **macOS:** Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, drag the VS Code icon to the Applications folder, and then open it from there.
   - **Linux:** Install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install code
     ```

4. **Launch:** Once installed, launch VS Code using the Start menu, application launcher, or terminal.

**Installing Python Extension:**

1. **Open VS Code:** Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Install Extension:**
   - Click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X`).
   - Search for "Python" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Install the "Python" extension provided by Microsoft.

That's it! You now have Visual Studio Code installed as your Python editor, complete with the Python extension for coding, debugging, and more.

Remember, there are other Python editors and IDEs available as well, so you can choose the one that suits your needs and preferences. The installation process for most editors follows a similar pattern: download the installer, install the software, and optionally add extensions or plugins for enhanced Python development features.


**Other Python Editors**

While VS Code is a popular choice, there are other Python-specific editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) available as well. Here are a few alternatives:

PyCharm: A dedicated Python IDE developed by JetBrains. It comes in both free (Community) and paid (Professional) versions.
Spyder: A scientific Python IDE with built-in tools for data analysis and visualization.
Thonny: A beginner-friendly IDE designed for teaching programming to new learners.
To install these editors, you can follow similar steps: download the installer from their respective websites and follow the installation instructions.

Ultimately, the choice of editor depends on your personal preferences, coding needs, and the features you're looking for. Regardless of which editor you choose, having a dedicated Python editor can significantly improve your coding efficiency and help you write better code.
