# Task-Organizer

A task organizer, also known as a task manager or to-do list app, is a simple tool designed to help individuals or teams manage their tasks, prioritize activities, and keep track of their progress. Task organizers are used to streamline workflows, increase productivity, and ensure that important tasks are completed efficiently. They come in various forms, from simple paper-based systems to feature-rich digital applications.

The core feature of a task organizer is the ability to create and maintain a list of tasks. Users can add, delete, update, toggle task status, display and save tasks.

This project contains a graphical user interface that is built using Python and the Tkinter library
